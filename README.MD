# FPGA Guessing Game

Developed by [Alicja Mahr](https://github.com/braxton) (Boston University) and Jackson Kahn (Cornell University) for the final project of [ENG EC 311](https://www.bu.edu/academics/eng/courses/eng-ec-311/) (taught by [Tali Moreshet](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/tali-moreshet/))

Simple verilog implementation of a number guessing game. Players may select between one player (Player vs AI) and two player (Player vs Player) modes. The game keeps track of the running score and the number of guesses used by each player. Players are shown the number of correct and misplaced values after they submit a guess.
